.SH NAME

_printf \- Output Conversion 

.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "holberton.h"

void _printf(char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

The _printf() function writes output to stdout, the standard output. Writes output under 
the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

.B Return value

Upon successful return, return the number of characters 
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

.B format of the format string

The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its 
initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or 
more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged 
to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of wich results 
in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

.B The flag characters


.B The field width


.B The precision


.B The length modifier


.B The converion specifier

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The 
conversion specifier and their meanings are:

.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.B c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting 
character is written.

.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character 
type (pointer or string). Characters from the array are written up to (but no including)
a terminating null byte ('\0').

.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.B r
Reverse the string passed (without the null byte).

.B R
Change the string to rot13 mode.
